<h3>IIT</h3>
<p>The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are an autonomous public technical and research university located in India.[1] They are governed by the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 which has declared them as institutions of national importance and lays down their powers, duties, and framework for governance.[2][3] The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 lists twenty-three institutes.[4] Each IIT is autonomous, linked to the others through a common council (IIT Council), which oversees their administration. The Minister of Human Resource Development is the ex officio Chairperson of the IIT Council.[5] As of 2018, the total number of seats for undergraduate programs in all IITs is 11,279.[6] The only major requirement to admit to these institutions is to pass the JEE Advanced.</p>
